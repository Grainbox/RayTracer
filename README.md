# Raytracer Project

This is a Raytracer project developed for Epitech. The Raytracer is a computer graphics technique used to create realistic images by simulating the path of light rays. This project aims to implement a basic Raytracer using the C programming language.

## Features

- **Basic Shapes**: The Raytracer supports rendering of basic geometric shapes such as spheres, planes, and cylinders.
- **Shading and Lighting**: The project includes shading and lighting models to calculate the colors and shadows of objects in the scene.
- **Reflection and Refraction**: The Raytracer supports reflection and refraction effects for objects with reflective or transparent surfaces.
- **Texture Mapping**: The project includes texture mapping techniques to apply images or patterns to objects in the scene.
- **Anti-Aliasing**: The Raytracer implements anti-aliasing techniques to reduce the jagged edges in rendered images.
- **Multithreading**: The rendering process is optimized by utilizing multithreading to distribute the workload across multiple CPU cores.

## Installation

To build and run the Raytracer project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/your_username/raytracer.git`
2. Change to the project directory: `cd raytracer`
3. Build the project: `make`
4. Run the Raytracer: `./raytracer scene_file.json output_image.png`

Make sure you have the necessary dependencies installed, such as the C compiler and relevant libraries.
